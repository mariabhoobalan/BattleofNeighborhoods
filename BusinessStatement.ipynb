    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to identify the best possible location to establish a laundromat in a given city/neighborhood. \n",

    "With numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. With the huge inflex of tourists, the demand of hotels and BnB stays keeps increasing in multifold. This has a direct influenze in the demand for laundromat services as well. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of the project is to identify the areas in Toronto where the laundromat/Hotels ratio is low, so it can be considered for establishing new laundromat establishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto,Canada With numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year is considered for this study\n",
