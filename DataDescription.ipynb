    "### Geo coordinates\n",
    "The geographical coordinates for each of the neighbourhoods can be obtained by downloading the data in csv from the following link\n",
    "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs_v1/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv\")\n",
