    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to identify the best possible location to establish a laundromat in a given city/neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "The city consider for this study is Toronto, Canada.Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario and is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America.Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "With numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. With the huge inflex of tourists, the demand of hotels and BnB stays keeps increasing in multifold. This has a direct influenze in the demand for laundromat services as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Project aims at helping the laundromat business to establish new services in places where the demand is high but not met. There by helping to provide a profitable laundry service with less competition. This would eventually play a key role in influenzing the touritst to choose the near by accomodations for their visit\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of the project is to identify the areas in Toronto where the laundromat/Hotels ratio is low, so it can be considered for establishing new laundromat establishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Location\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto,Canada With numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year is considered for this study\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Location data provider\n",
    "\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its location data gathering source. The Foursquare Places API provides location based experiences with diverse information about venues, users, photos, and check-ins. The API supports real time access to places, Snap-to-Place that assigns users to specific locations, and Geo-tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Heirarchical Clustering will be used in this project. This is because there is no need for a cluster number to be selected and the custering can be purely based on the distance between the venues. The resulting clusters were plotted on a Folium map.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data about neighborhoods\n",
    "In order to perform the analysis for the project. we required the locations of existing accomodations(Hotels, Motels) and laundromats. The data gathering starts with capturing all the neighbourhoods in Toronto. This data can be fetched from the following Wiki Link\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M (oldid: 954731857)\n",

    "### 2.3 Data selection\n",
    "Data corresponding to the neighborhood of Toronto alone will be considered for this study. Filtering is done based on Borough that contains 'Toronto' in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Foursquare API\n",
    "The geo locations for the required neighborhoods will be fed into the Foursquare API along with keywords like hotels, motels, laudry, laundromats to fetch the corresponding data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering will be done on the above mentioned data for Laundromats and Hotels seperately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Folium map will be used to visualize the clusters, using which the conclusion will be arrived. "

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Gathering and processing the data corresponding to the location under study\n",
    "1. The perliminary step to begin this analysis is to capture all the necessary data related to the location that we take for the study. The location considered in this case is Toronto, Canada.\n",
    "2. The first required data is the list of neighborhoods in and around Toronto. The data is obtained from the wikipedia link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M (oldid: 954731857).\n",
    "3. BeautifulSoup library is used to scrap the data from the above mentioned link. A dataframe is created out of the resulted data. The raw data is processed and cleaned to get a more simplified informtion that is analysis ready.\n",
    "4. The second most important data required is the coordinates for each of the neighbourhoods in Toronto. The geo coordinates were taken from the readily available geospatial csv from the following link - https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs_v1/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv\"\n",
    "5. Both these two seperate data were matched based on the postal code and a final dataframe is created, which primarily includes the neighborhood names, postal codes, latitudes and longitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Collect information about the existing laudries and accomodation facilities\n",
    "1. Foursquare API will be used to query all the listed neighborhoods of central Toronto for the currently active hotels, motels, laudromats.\n",
    "2. The latitudes and logitudes from the earlier created dataframe will be used as an input for these queries.\n",
    "3. The result will be stored into new dataframes. \n",
    "4. Folium will be used to visualise each of these venues in the map for better visual understanding.\n",
    "5. Heirarchial clustering will be performed on the laudry and hotel data to identify the concentration of each of the venues in the neighborhoods.\n",
    "6. The final clustering data will be plotted using folium. This gives a better understanding of areas with adequate or scarce establishment of hotels and laudromats.\n",
    "7. For our conclusion purpose, the areas which has more hotels and less laudromats will be suggested for establishing new laudry services. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Results\n",
    "1. A total of 9 neighborhoods were identified within central Toronto.\n",
    "2. A total of 111 laudromat venues were listed within central Toronto.\n",
    "3. A total of 90 Hotel venues were listed within central Toronto.\n",
    "4. Based on Heirarchial clustering, 6 clusters of Laudromats and 4 clusters of hotels were generated.\n",
    "5. The laudromat to Hotels ratio is very less in the ForestHill neighborhood. It has got 6 hotels with no associated laudry services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Discussions\n",
    "1. As assumed earlier, in most of the neighborhoods, the hotel clusters and the laudromat clusters overlap each other. \n",
    "2. Majority of the hotels are found in and around the Yorkville neighborhood. The main reason could be the presence of the museum and university around this neighborhood. We could also see a complimenting numbers of laudromats around this neighborhood.\n",
    "3. The annex neighborhood got the ratio of laudromat to hotel very high as it turns out to be more of a residential area along with schools, which raises a demand for laudry services inspite of having lesser hotels.\n",
    "4. The Forest Hill neighborhood got a small cluster of hotels but does not have any laudry establishments to meet the need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusions\n",
    "Based on the above results and discussions, we shall come to a conclusion that the Foresthill neighborhood is the most suitable candidate for launching a new laundromat services, which might satify the demand and stands for a profitable business establishment."
